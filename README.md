# Pixel-Sketch

I created a Pixel Sketch page using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Each "pixel" on the sketchpad is an individual div element that is created and appended to a div container using a for loop. Classes and event listeners are applied to each individual div when created. The "pixels" are created and re-created each time the size of the sketchpad is adjusted.

The page is responsive to viewport size and is functional on Android mobile. The dynamic background used for this page is from [Vanta JS](https://github.com/tengbao/vanta).

Things I learned:
- Target individual and multiple nodes with selectors.
- Create, append, and remove multiple elements from the DOM using loops.
- Add, modify, and remove multiple element attributes within the DOM using loops.
- Use event listeners to create a dynamic page.
- Apply event listeners to multiple nodes using loops and nodelist.
